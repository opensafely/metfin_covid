# Implications of metformin for (Long) COVID

[View on OpenSAFELY](https://jobs.opensafely.org/repo/https%253A%252F%252Fgithub.com%252Fopensafely%252Fmetfin_covid)

Recent evidence from a placebo-controlled randomised clinical trial (COVID-OUT: https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(23)00299-2) suggested that administering metformin during the acute stage of COVID-19 infection lowers the likelihood of developing Long COVID. Treatment with metformin reduced long COVID incidence by about 41%, with an absolute reduction of 4,1%, compared to placebo. This interesting finding warrants further investigation, and to guide treatment policy, effectiveness studies, especially from routine care data, are needed. The aim of this study is to, first, understand the prescription pattern and timing of metformin among people diagnosed with type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and pre-T2DM in OpenSAFELY. Second, to assess how many who are diagnosed with T2DM also have a recent COVID-19 infection. Third, to conceptualise and conduct a target trial emulation estimating the incidence of Long COVID among (at-risk of) T2DM patients treated with metformin vs no metformin.
